## Exercise 1:
max_bright value: 45000
min_bright value: 20000

We tested this in a fairly bright photonics lab room, so to achieve a dim light we considered casting a shadow with our hand over the photocell to qualify, and the value of 20000 for min_bright corresponded to a 0% duty cycle of the led when shadowing the photocell. 

The max bright value we found was 45000 and when shining a phone flashlight we were able to achieve around 100% duty cycle with the led.

## Exercise 2:
We decided to play 'happy birthday'  using an array of frequencies and iterating through this array while simultaneously iterating through a second array for sound durations. 

## Exercise 3: 

We included dictionary entries for the average reaction time, max time, min time, and score, doing the appropriate calculations with the variables given.
We uploaded our reaction time data onto this link:
