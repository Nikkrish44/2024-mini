Exercise 1:
max_bright value: 45000
min_bright value: 20000
//we tested this in a fairly bright photonics lab room, so to achieve a dim light we considered casting a shadow with our hand over the photocell to qualify,
and the value of 20000 for min_bright corresponded to a 0% duty cycle of the led when shadowing the photocell. 
//the max bright value we found was 45000 and when shining a phone flashlight we were able to achieve around 100% duty cycle with the led.

Exercise 2:
We played the happy birthday song using an array of frequencies and iterating through this array while simultaneously iterating through a second array for sound durations.
